# EMVisual
This project creates a visualization tool for electric and magnetic fields. The different configurations it deals with (initially) are:
  1. Uniform fields
  2. Time varying fields
  3. Non uniform fields

Physical phenomenon such as magnetic mirror and earth's magnetic field can be demonstrated by "EMVisual".
It creates animations and plots of field lines. In addition to field, the energy, momentum and trajectory w.r.t. a charge particle can be visualized by EMVisual.
